**INSIGHTS**

After performing statistical operations on the dataset, we deduct several valuable insights:

1. Most of the users fall under age group 31-40 years (1,007) followed by 41-50 years (977)

2. Most of the users are from Spain (451) and The USA (451)

3. Most of the users have subscribed to the most affordable package i.e., Basic ($10 mothlly)

4. Spain has the highest count of Premium subscribers, there are no premium subscriptions in Mexico and UK and there are no standard subscriptions in France.

5. Women only have a higher count in the Basic package, males dominate in the rest.

6. Basic package generated the most revenues, $12,469 and premium package the least, $9,229

7. USA and Spain generated the highest revenues

8. Age group 31-40 years generated the highest revenues $12,543.

9. Laptops are the most used devices whilst TVs are the least used

10. In Basic and Premium, most users use their laptops whilst for standard most people use their Tablets

11. The middle age group 31-40 has the highest count across all packages

12. Monthly revenues have been on a downward fall since November 2022

**POSSIBLE DECISIONS**

3.More relevant content for age groups 31-40 and 41-50 should be produced

4.Netflix should research ad ramp up production of content relevant to age group 19-30

5.Spain culture shows should be maximised as Spain has performed so well.

6.There should be attractive incentives to attract users from basic to premium and standard

7.There should be research on why there are almost zero premium and standard subscriptions in Italy

8. Netflix should maximise on the high count of female subscription in Spain.

9. Netflix can strategize on producing shows that can efforlessly be watched on the go since the most used devices are mobile.
